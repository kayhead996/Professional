# Code Samples
This repository contains code samples including samples in Java, C++, C, and Android.

## Java
This project contains a stack and a queue and various commands such as push, pop, enqueue, dequeue, etc. to manipulate the data structures.

## C
These projects use various system calls to implement programs like a file selector project implemented in a terminal, a client/server chat program using sockets, or a shell with limited functionality. All of these programs rely on a user-defined string library which replaces the UNIX standard string library.

## C++
This project is a file system simulator using a general tree to store the directories and files.

## Android
This project is a bookstore app which is implented using ContentProviders in Android. All the work, however, is done on the UI thread. This app allows users to add books to a cart, generates random IDs and prices for books, saves them to a SQLlite database table and gives the options for checkout.

## Python
This project is a neural network for binary classification using matplotlib, numpy, and sklearn. The neural network implements L2 regularization and a learning rate
