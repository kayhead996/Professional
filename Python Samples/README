1) To run the neural net, first install matplotlib, sklearn, and numpy
2) It can be ran with the inputs I used by running "python3 neural_network.py --noinput"
3) To specify inputs through user input, just run "python3 neural_network.py" and enter the data as follows:
    size: int value > 0
    number of hidden neurons: int value > 0
    dataset number: either a 1 or 2
    early stop: 1 to use the stopping method using the test data as specified in the homework doc, or 0 to specify the number of iterations
    number of iterations (optional): number of iterations to run
    learning rate: float value (0.0004 recommended)
    regularizer: float value (0.1 recommended)
